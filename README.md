# IQM
A Prolog package for Initial Quasi Manifold decomposition.
This is a proof of concept prototype for the results in the thesis: [Decomposition and Modeling in the Non-Manifold Domain](https://www.academia.edu/38601865/Decomposition_and_Modeling_in_the_Non-Manifold_Domain)
## Examples
Included there are some examples about different parts of the package
### File equivalencetest.pl 
contains an example about partitioning a set w.r.t. a equivalence relation.
### File boundarytest.pl
contains an example about boundary calculations in a 2-complex and in a 3-complex
### File test1.pl
contains a tiny example about a tiny triangulation
### File non-pseudo-complex.pl 
studies a tetrahedralization  reported as Example 7.4.2. in the thesis above.
